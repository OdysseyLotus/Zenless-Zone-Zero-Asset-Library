# Zenless-Zone-Zero-Asset-Library
A library of texture resources for ZZZ.

These are DDS files (JPGs for the icons for some reason) for the game. Once the collect tool for ZZZ has been created, I'll gather those assets and upload them as well, but for now, it is just textures. If you notice anything/anyone missing or something wrong, please let me know. The files are currently named after their hash, but that will probably change in the future as well.

I don't know what all the files do or what they control, so that's up to you to figure that out. I'll add more as time goes on. My current agenda is getting all the W-Engines (and hopefully Qingyi and Zhu Yuan, but I might have accidentally rushed past them in the story before thinking of grabbing their textures.

Contributors are welcome, just let me know.
